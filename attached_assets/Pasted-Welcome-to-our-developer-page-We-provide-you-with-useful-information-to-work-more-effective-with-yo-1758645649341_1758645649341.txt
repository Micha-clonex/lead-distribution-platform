IF THE MAIL IS NOT CORRECT WE DO NOT INSERT THE LEAD AS USING AUTOLOGIN WE GENERATE A RANDOM
PASSWORD FOR THE CLIENT AND THE PASSWORD WILL BE SENT VIA EMAIL. IF THE EMAIL IS NOT CORRECT IT CAN
NOT RECEIVE THE PASSWORD AND IT CAN NOT LOGIN NEXT TIME AND IT CAN NOT RESET THE PASSWORD AS THE
RESET LINK ARRIVES AT THE LOGIN EMAIL. so for this endpoint you should use real email for test. you can use noreply@domain.com
